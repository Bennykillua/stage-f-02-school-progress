# Student Gross Enrollment ForeCast
## The Task is to use machine learning to forecast gross enrollment in 2015-16, using data of 2012-15 session, such as dropout rate, water and computer facilities. 
## In this notebook I approached the task as a classification problem and seperated the gross enrollment into 2 groups.

#### Approach 
* Joined Datasets
* Preprocessed Datasets
* Handled Missing Values 
* Treated Task as Binary Classification 
* KFold Validation
#### Improvements that can be made
* Feature Selection
* Feature Creation
* Hyper-parameter tuning
#### Requirements
- pip install requirements.txt
